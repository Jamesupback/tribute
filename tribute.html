            <ul>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Plank epoch:</span>The Planck scale is the physical scale beyond
                    which current physical theories may not apply, and cannot be used to calculate what happened. During
                    the
                    Planck epoch, cosmology
                    and physics are assumed to have been dominated by the quantum effects of gravity.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Grand
                        unification
                        epoch:</span>The three forces of the Standard Model are still unified (assuming that nature is
                    described by a Grand Unified Theory, gravity not included).</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Inflationary
                        epoch:</span>Cosmic inflation expands space by a factor of the order of 1026 over a time of the
                    order
                    of 10 -36 to 10−32 seconds. The universe is supercooled from about 1027 down to 1022 Kelvins.[11]
                    The
                    strong interaction becomes distinct from the electroweak interaction.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Electroweak
                        epoch ends:</span>Before temperature falls below 150 GeV, average energy of particle
                    interactions is
                    high enough that it's more succinct to describe them as exchange of W1, W2, W3, and B vector bosons
                    (electroweak interactions) and H+, H-, H0, H0 *scalar bosons (Higgs interaction). In this picture,
                    vacuum expectation value of Higgs field is zero (therefore all fermions are massless), all
                    electroweak
                    bosons are massless (they had not yet "eaten" a component of Higgs field to become massive), and
                    photons
                    (γ) do not yet exist (they will exist after phase transition as linear combination of B and W3
                    bosons, γ
                    = B cos θW + W3 sin θW, where θW is Weinberg angle). These are the highest energies directly
                    observable
                    in the Large Hadron Collider. The sphere of space that will become the observable universe is
                    approximately 300 light-seconds in radius at this time.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Quark epoch:</span>The forces of the Standard Model have
                    reorganized
                    into the "low-temperature" form: Higgs and electroweak interactions rearranged into massive Higgs
                    boson
                    H0, weak force carried by massive W+, W-, and Z0 bosons, and electromagnetism carried by massless
                    photons. Higgs field has nonzero vacuum expectation value, making fermions massive. Energies are too
                    high for quarks to coalesce into hadrons, instead forming a quark–gluon plasma.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Hadron epoch:</span>Quarks are bound into hadrons. A slight
                    matter-antimatter asymmetry from the earlier phases (baryon asymmetry) results in an elimination of
                    anti-baryons. Up until 0.1 s, muons and pions are in thermal equllibrium, and outnumber baryons by
                    about
                    10:1. Close to the end of this epoch, only light stable baryons (protons and neutrons) remain. Due
                    to
                    sufficiently high density of leptons, protons and neutrons rapidly change into one another under the
                    action of weak force. Due to higher mass of neutron the neutron:proton ratio, which is initially
                    1:1,
                    starts to decrease</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Neutrino
                        decoupling:</span>Neutrinos cease interacting with baryonic matter, and form cosmic neutrino
                    background. Neutron:proton ratio freezes at approximately 1:6. The sphere of space that will become
                    the
                    observable universe is approximately 10 light-years in radius at this time</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Lepton epoch:</span>Leptons and antileptons remain in thermal
                    equilibrium – energy of photons is still high enough to produce electron-positron pairs.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Big Bang
                        nucleosynthesis:</span>Protons and neutrons are bound into primordial atomic nuclei: hydrogen
                    and
                    helium-4. Trace amounts of deuterium, helium-3, and lithium-7 also form. At the end of this epoch,
                    the
                    spherical volume of space which will become the observable universe is about 300 light-years in
                    radius,
                    baryonic matter density is on the order of 4 grams per m3 (about 0.3% of sea level air density) –
                    however, most energy at this time is in electromagnetic radiation.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Photon epoch:</span>The universe consists of a plasma of nuclei,
                    electrons, and photons; temperature is too low to create electron-positron pairs (or any other pairs
                    of
                    massive particles), but too high for the binding of electrons to nuclei.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Recombination:</span>Electrons and atomic nuclei first become bound
                    to
                    form neutral atoms. Photons are no longer in thermal equilibrium with matter and the universe first
                    becomes transparent. Recombination lasts for about 100 ka, during which universe is becoming more
                    and
                    more transparent to photons. The photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation originate at
                    this
                    time. The spherical volume of space which will become the observable universe is 42 million
                    light-years
                    in radius at this time. The baryonic matter density at this time is about 500 million hydrogen and
                    helium atoms per m3, approximately a billion times higher than today. This density corresponds to
                    pressure on the order of 10−17 atm.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Dark Ages:</span>The earliest known galaxies existed by about 380
                    Ma.
                    Galaxies coalesce into "proto-clusters" from about 1 Ga (redshift z = 6 ) and into galaxy clusters
                    beginning at 3 Ga ( z = 2.1 ), and into superclusters from about 5 Ga ( z = 1.2 ). See: list of
                    galaxy
                    groups and clusters, list of superclusters.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Reionization:</span>The most distant astronomical objects
                    observable
                    with telescopes date to this period; as of 2016, the most remote galaxy observed is GN-z11, at a
                    redshift of 11.09. The earliest "modern" Population I stars are formed in this period.</li>
                <li class="info"><span class="title">Present time:</span>Farthest observable photons at this moment are
                    CMB
                    photons. They arrive from a sphere with the radius of 46 billion light-years. The spherical volume
                    inside it is commonly referred to as the observable universe.</li>
